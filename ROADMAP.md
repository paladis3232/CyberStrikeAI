## Released (v1.x)

### Core Platform
- ✅ AI agent engine with OpenAI-compatible model support (GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)
- ✅ Native MCP implementation — HTTP, stdio, and SSE transports
- ✅ External MCP federation (HTTP / stdio / SSE modes)
- ✅ 100+ prebuilt tool recipes in YAML
- ✅ YAML-based tool extension system (hot-reload from `tools/` directory)
- ✅ Large-result pagination, compression, and searchable archives
- ✅ SQLite persistence for conversations, vulnerabilities, and audit logs
- ✅ Password-protected Web UI with Bearer-token auth and session management
- ✅ Streaming SSE output for real-time task progress

### Security Testing Features
- ✅ Role-based testing system (12+ predefined roles: Penetration Testing, CTF, Web App Scanning, API Security, Binary Analysis, Cloud Security Audit, etc.)
- ✅ Skills system (20+ predefined skills: SQL injection, XSS, API security, container security, etc.)
- ✅ Attack-chain graph with severity scoring and step-by-step replay
- ✅ Vulnerability management — CRUD, severity/status tracking, statistics
- ✅ Batch task management — create queues, add tasks, sequential execution with full status tracking
- ✅ Knowledge base with vector search and hybrid (vector + keyword) retrieval
- ✅ Auto-indexing of Markdown knowledge files with incremental updates
- ✅ FOFA / ZoomEye search engine integration

### Integrations & UX
- ✅ DingTalk and Lark (Feishu) chatbot via persistent long-lived connections
- ✅ Web console with terminal, task monitor, conversation groups, and role selector
- ✅ Conversation grouping — pinning, renaming, batch management
- ✅ MCP stdio mode for Cursor / IDE integration
- ✅ OpenAPI documentation endpoint

## Near-Term (Next 1–2 Releases)

### Agent & Orchestration
- 📋 **Parallel tool execution** — allow the agent to fan out independent tool calls concurrently to reduce total time on multi-step engagements
- 📋 **Agent memory improvements** — smarter context window management for very long sessions (>200 tool calls)
- 📋 **Structured task templates** — YAML-defined recon/pentest playbooks that the agent can load and execute end-to-end
- 📋 **Tool chaining macros** — define multi-step pipelines (e.g., subfinder → httpx → nuclei) as a single named operation

### UI / UX
- 📋 **Fully translated English UI** — complete localization of all UI text (in progress in this release)
- 📋 **Dark / light theme toggle** — user-configurable color scheme
- 📋 **Improved attack-chain export** — export as PDF, PNG, or JSON for reporting
- 📋 **Vulnerability report generator** — one-click HTML/Markdown pentest report from discovered vulnerabilities
- 📋 **Real-time collaboration** — allow multiple users to observe or join a running session

### Integrations
- 📋 **Slack / Teams bot** — extend the chatbot system to Slack and Microsoft Teams
- 📋 **Webhook notifications** — send task completion, vulnerability discovery, or attack-chain events to external systems (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
- 📋 **JIRA / GitHub Issues integration** — automatically create issues from discovered vulnerabilities

---

## Mid-Term (3–6 Months)

### AI & Automation
- 📋 **Multi-model routing** — automatically select the best model (reasoning model for complex planning, faster model for tool execution) to optimize cost and latency
- 📋 **Autonomous recon-to-report pipeline** — fully automated end-to-end pentest workflow from target scoping to final report generation
- 📋 **RAG-enhanced agent** — deeper integration of the knowledge base into agent decision-making for better tool selection and exploit guidance
- 📋 **Custom agent personas** — allow organizations to define their own agent behavior, escalation rules, and toolset restrictions
- 📋 **Fine-tuned security model support** — tested integration with security-focused fine-tuned models

### Security & Compliance
- 📋 **Multi-user RBAC** — role-based access control with user accounts, scoped permissions (read-only analyst, full operator, admin)
- 📋 **Audit log export** — export structured audit logs (JSON / SYSLOG) to SIEM systems
- 📋 **Engagement scoping** — define authorized target scope and enforce tool/output restrictions within scope boundaries
- 📋 **Data retention policies** — auto-purge or archive old conversations and results

### Tool Ecosystem
- 📋 **Tool marketplace / registry** — community-contributed tool recipes with one-click import
- 📋 **Tool sandboxing** — optional Docker/container isolation for each tool invocation
- 📋 **Tool health monitoring** — detect missing or misconfigured tools and suggest installation commands
- 📋 **Burp Suite extension** — native Burp extension for bi-directional traffic sharing with CyberStrikeAI

### Knowledge Base
- 📋 **Auto-knowledge ingestion** — automatically import CVE details, exploit-db entries, and security advisories into the knowledge base
- 📋 **Knowledge base sharing** — export and import knowledge bases as portable bundles
- 📋 **Semantic deduplication** — automatically merge near-duplicate knowledge items

## Long-Term / Under Consideration

### Platform
- 💡 **Web-based IDE / notebook** — Jupyter-like interface for scripting custom pentest workflows
- 💡 **Plugin architecture** — first-class SDK for third-party integrations beyond MCP
- 💡 **Distributed agent execution** — run agents across multiple nodes for large-scale assessments
- 💡 **API gateway proxy** — transparent security testing proxy mode for API testing
- 💡 **Mobile app** — native iOS/Android companion app

### AI
- 💡 **Reasoning traces / chain-of-thought display** — show the AI's reasoning steps in the UI for transparency
- 💡 **Human-in-the-loop mode** — require explicit approval before executing high-risk tools
- 💡 **Adaptive learning** — capture operator feedback on agent decisions to improve future recommendations
- 💡 **Vulnerability correlation engine** — automatically correlate findings across multiple engagements to identify patterns

### Community
- 💡 **Role / skill / tool sharing hub** — centralized repository for community-contributed roles, skills, and tools
- 💡 **CTF challenge integration** — direct integration with CTF platforms (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, PicoCTF) for practice mode
- 💡 **Certification exam assistance mode** — guided study mode for OSCP, CEH, and similar certifications
