## Released (v1.x)

### Core Platform
- ✅ AI agent engine with OpenAI-compatible model support (GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)
- ✅ Native MCP implementation — HTTP, stdio, and SSE transports
- ✅ External MCP federation (HTTP / stdio / SSE modes)
- ✅ 140+ prebuilt tool recipes in YAML
- ✅ YAML-based tool extension system (hot-reload from `tools/` directory)
- ✅ Large-result pagination, compression, and searchable archives
- ✅ SQLite persistence for conversations, vulnerabilities, and audit logs
- ✅ Password-protected Web UI with Bearer-token auth and session management
- ✅ Streaming SSE output for real-time task progress
- ✅ **Docker lifecycle management** — deploy, update, start, stop, restart, remove via `run_docker.sh` or System Settings UI; REST API (`/api/docker/status`, `/api/docker/logs`, `/api/docker/action`); proxy (SOCKS/HTTP/Tor) and VPN-container modes

### Security Testing Features
- ✅ Role-based testing system (13 predefined roles: Penetration Testing, CTF, Web App Scanning, API Security, Binary Analysis, Cloud Security Audit, Digital Forensics, Container Security, Post-Exploitation, etc.)
- ✅ Skills system (24 predefined skills: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, XXE, Command injection, File upload, IDOR, Deserialization, API security, Android reverse engineering, Container security, Cloud security audit, Network penetration, Mobile app security, LDAP/XPath injection, Incident response, Secure code review, Vulnerability assessment, Security automation, Security awareness training, Bitrix24 webhook exploitation, Business logic testing, and more)
- ✅ Attack-chain graph with severity scoring and step-by-step replay
- ✅ Vulnerability management — CRUD, severity/status tracking, statistics
- ✅ Batch task management — create queues, add tasks, sequential execution with full status tracking
- ✅ Knowledge base with vector search and hybrid (vector + BM25 keyword) retrieval
- ✅ **Corpus-level BM25 Okapi** — real inverse document frequency scoring built from all indexed chunks; replaces the previous per-document approximation
- ✅ Auto-indexing of Markdown knowledge files with incremental updates
- ✅ FOFA / ZoomEye search engine integration
- ✅ **WebShell Management** — built-in webshell connection manager (PHP/ASP/ASPX/JSP); xterm.js virtual terminal for command execution; remote file manager (list, upload, download, read, edit, delete); AI Assistant tab with streaming agent loop and per-connection conversation history; REST API (`/api/webshell/connections`, `/api/webshell/exec`, `/api/webshell/file`)

### Agent Intelligence
- ✅ **Persistent memory** — cross-session key-value store (SQLite-backed) with 8 categories (credential, target, vulnerability, fact, note, tool_run, discovery, plan); survives conversation compression; exposed as four agent tools (`store_memory`, `retrieve_memory`, `list_memories`, `delete_memory`); tool results automatically persisted as `tool_run` memory entries
- ✅ **Agent introspection** — before every major action the agent runs a mandatory memory-similarity check and knowledge-base preflight; entity-based memory lookup for IP/domain targets; `<memory_similarity_context>` injected into system prompt to prevent duplicate scans
- ✅ **Time awareness** — current date/time, timezone, and session age automatically injected into every system prompt; configurable via `agent.time_awareness`; `get_current_time` tool for on-demand queries

### Integrations & UX
- ✅ Lark (Feishu) chatbot via persistent long-lived connections
- ✅ Telegram bot via long-polling — multi-user, progress streaming, MCP tool control, role and conversation management; configurable via Web UI
- ✅ Web console with terminal, task monitor, conversation groups, and role selector
- ✅ Conversation grouping — pinning, renaming, batch management
- ✅ MCP stdio mode for Cursor / IDE integration
- ✅ OpenAPI documentation endpoint

---

## Near-Term (Next 1–2 Releases)

### Agent & Orchestration
- ✅ **Parallel tool execution** — agent fans out independent tool calls concurrently to reduce total time on multi-step engagements
- ✅ **Agent memory improvements** — persistent cross-session memory store with category tagging; BM25 corpus index for smarter knowledge retrieval; paginated Memory UI with scrolling and category filters
- ✅ **Memory UI panel** — web interface to view, search, edit, and delete persistent memory entries; category filters; stats strip; bulk delete; paginated loading
- 📋 **Memory expiry / TTL** — optional time-to-live on memory entries so stale facts are automatically purged
- 📋 **Structured task templates** — YAML-defined recon/pentest playbooks that the agent can load and execute end-to-end
- 📋 **Tool chaining macros** — define multi-step pipelines (e.g., subfinder → httpx → nuclei) as a single named operation

### UI / UX
- ✅ **Fully translated English UI** — `i18n.js` module shipped with English and Chinese translations; all hardcoded Chinese strings in `chat.js`, `monitor.js`, and `vulnerability.js` replaced with English equivalents; full-width punctuation (`：`, `！`) normalized to ASCII
- ✅ **Dark / light theme toggle** — user-configurable dark/light color scheme; toggle button in the header; preference persisted in localStorage
- 📋 **Improved attack-chain export** — export as PDF, PNG, or JSON for reporting
- 📋 **Vulnerability report generator** — one-click HTML/Markdown pentest report from discovered vulnerabilities
- 📋 **Real-time collaboration** — allow multiple users to observe or join a running session

### Integrations
- 📋 **Slack / Teams bot** — extend the chatbot system to Slack and Microsoft Teams
- 📋 **Webhook notifications** — send task completion, vulnerability discovery, or attack-chain events to external systems (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
- 📋 **JIRA / GitHub Issues integration** — automatically create issues from discovered vulnerabilities
- 📋 **Telegram inline keyboard** — add interactive buttons (confirm/cancel actions, quick role switching) to Telegram bot responses
- 📋 **Telegram file transfer** — send large tool output as downloadable files when the result exceeds the message size limit

---

## Mid-Term (3–6 Months)

### AI & Automation
- 📋 **Multi-model routing** — automatically select the best model (reasoning model for complex planning, faster model for tool execution) to optimize cost and latency
- 📋 **Autonomous recon-to-report pipeline** — fully automated end-to-end pentest workflow from target scoping to final report generation
- ✅ **RAG-enhanced agent** — deeper integration of the knowledge base into agent decision-making for better tool selection and exploit guidance; proactive context injection based on task semantics
- 📋 **Custom agent personas** — allow organizations to define their own agent behavior, escalation rules, and toolset restrictions
- 📋 **Fine-tuned security model support** — tested integration with security-focused fine-tuned models

### Security & Compliance
- 📋 **Multi-user RBAC** — role-based access control with user accounts, scoped permissions (read-only analyst, full operator, admin)
- 📋 **Audit log export** — export structured audit logs (JSON / SYSLOG) to SIEM systems
- 📋 **Engagement scoping** — define authorized target scope and enforce tool/output restrictions within scope boundaries
- 📋 **Data retention policies** — auto-purge or archive old conversations and results

### Tool Ecosystem
- 📋 **Tool marketplace / registry** — community-contributed tool recipes with one-click import
- 📋 **Tool sandboxing** — optional Docker/container isolation for each tool invocation
- 📋 **Tool health monitoring** — detect missing or misconfigured tools and suggest installation commands
- 📋 **Burp Suite extension** — native Burp extension for bi-directional traffic sharing with CyberStrikeAI

### Knowledge Base
- 📋 **Auto-knowledge ingestion** — automatically import CVE details, exploit-db entries, and security advisories into the knowledge base
- 📋 **Knowledge base sharing** — export and import knowledge bases as portable bundles
- 📋 **Semantic deduplication** — automatically merge near-duplicate knowledge items
- 📋 **BM25 index persistence** — store the BM25 corpus index on disk so it does not need to be rebuilt on every startup
